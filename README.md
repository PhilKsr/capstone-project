## Installing / Developing

First, clone this repository

Now you are ready to go:

```shell
npm install
```


This will install the dependencies required to run the app.

```shell
npm run dev
```

These scripts run your server and client. Connect your database and discover!


You can configure the server port by setting the `PORT` environment variable. Creating a `.env` file is supported. You can copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

| KEY  | VALUE                                                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PORT | (Optional) Port for the server environment                    |


To make sure that you can easily use it I have explained some features of the map:

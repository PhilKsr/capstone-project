# Welcome to roAdventure!

The Webapp helps you to plan the best roadtrips ever. To make sure that you can easily use it I have explained some features of the map:

## 1. Location button
- Find yourself with the Location button
- Make sure your location is enabled

## 2. Reset button
- Reset all added locations from a roadtrip
- If you edit a roadtrip the reset is not set until you click on the save button

## 3. Visibility button
- To much noise? no problem! Just click on the visibility button to hide all locations except the roadtrip

## 4. Save button
- Don't forget to save your edits
- No matter if it's a new or a existing roadtrip

## 5. Filter button
- Filter the displayed locations 

## 6. Pin Button
- Click to activate and a pin is dropped wherever you click on the map
- Do us a favour and add a new location with the popup
